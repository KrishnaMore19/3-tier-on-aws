## Application Code
The `Application-Code` directory contains the source code for the Three-Tier Web Application, including frontend and backend implementations.

## Jenkins Pipeline Code
The `Jenkins-Pipeline-Code` directory includes Jenkins pipeline scripts that automate the CI/CD process for seamless integration and deployment.

## Jenkins Server Terraform
Find Terraform scripts in the `Jenkins-Server-TF` directory to provision and configure the Jenkins server on AWS.

## Kubernetes Manifests Files
The `Kubernetes-Manifests-Files` directory contains Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application components on AWS EKS.

## Project Details
üõ†Ô∏è **Tools Used:**
- Terraform & AWS CLI for infrastructure provisioning
- Jenkins, Sonarqube, Terraform, Kubectl, and more for CI/CD automation
- Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana for monitoring and visualization
- ArgoCD for GitOps-based continuous delivery

üö¢ **High-Level Workflow:**
- AWS IAM user setup and infrastructure provisioning via Terraform
- Jenkins server deployment and integration with AWS
- EKS Cluster creation with Load Balancer setup
- Private ECR repositories for container image management
- Deployment of monitoring stack with Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana
- GitOps deployment strategy using ArgoCD for the Three-Tier application

üìà This project covers everything from infrastructure setup and CI/CD pipelines to monitoring and data persistence for a full production-ready deployment.

## Getting Started
Refer to the detailed guide to walk through IAM user creation, infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD setup, EKS cluster deployment, and application launch on AWS.

Happy Coding! üöÄ
